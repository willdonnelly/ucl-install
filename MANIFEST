  (synopsis "Basic UCL Package Manager")
  (description "A very basic package manager consisting of a \
                single library with the ability to install and \
                uninstall packages. Capable of installing packages \
                from repositories and from files, and allows a \
                specific package version to be selected, but does \
                only the most basic dependency handling during \
                installation, and has no user interface other \
                than the 'UCL-INSTALL' and 'UCL-UNINSTALL' functions.")
