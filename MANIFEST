(synopsis "Basic UCL Package Manager")
(description "A very basic package manager consisting of a \
              single library with the ability to install and \
              uninstall packages. Capable of installing packages \
              from repositories and from files, and allows a \
              specific package version to be selected, but does \
              only the most basic dependency handling during \
              installation, and has no user interface other \
              than the 'UCL-INSTALL' and 'UCL-UNINSTALL' functions.")
