UCL Package Repositories
========================

The entire system is designed with an eye towards making the repositories
as simple and robust as they possibly can be. To that end, the repository
is nothing more than a file server over HTTP. It consists of a single
directory containing package files and a list of all available packages.

The package list is named '.packages.gz', and is a list of all package
filenames, one per line, compressed by gzip.

Each package is named following the convention <name>-<version>.tar.gz,
like 'foobar-1.3.tar.gz' or 'baz-8.1.23.tar.gz'. Versions must consist
entirely of numbers, at least for the moment.

This is all done so that packages can simply be tossed into the repository,
and then the package index can be regenerated with a single command:
  'ls -1 | gzip > .packages.gz'
